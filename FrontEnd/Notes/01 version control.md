 version control is what like a magical undo button for your code it helps you keep track of every change you make, so you can go back and see what you did or fix mistakes. it's especially useful when you're working on a project other people
version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. if a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and computer earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

How Version Control Works ?
1. Repository(Repo): Think of a repository as a big , special folder on your computer where all your projects files are stored. This folder also keeps track of every change you make to those files.
2. Commit: A commit is like talking a snapshot of your projects at a certain time. you can write a little message with each commit what changes you made.
3. Branch: A branch is like a separate workspace for your project.
4. Merge: when you're happy with the changes you made in a branch, you can create branches to try out new ideas or features affecting the main project.
5. Conflict : Sometimes, changes from different branches clash with each other. Resolving conflicts ,means deciding which changes to keep..
